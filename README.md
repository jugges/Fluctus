# Take-a-Break-v2
Make you take a break in periods of times recommended for IT people.
## The breaks:sleeping:
1. Every time the minute counter hits 30 mins = A 1 minute break to walk around you'r workspace and relieve strain on your back :runner:

2. Every time the hour counter changes which means a hour passed by = A 10 minute brake from a display, a keyboard & a mouse :metal:
