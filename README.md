Make you take a break in periods of times recommended for IT people.
## More info about project soon...
Hi! if you just found out about this project why not test it?
more info will be out soon but until then I'll tell you a bit...
Fluctus was made to help me sit less time on my pc, it notifies you to take breaks every 30 minutes and two hours.
## How to quickly build Fluctus?
Replace the red sentence in the build bat with your msbuild.exe directory (msbuild.exe should support .net framework 4.5.2)

(run the bat file to build as release for better performance over debug)
